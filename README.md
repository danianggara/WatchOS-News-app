# WatchOS-News-app
A News app on your Watch

This is my first WatchOS app. So this is a news app that you can access through your watch, Apple Watch of course.
You can access up-to-date news. I'm using the News API. Basically News API is a simple, easy-to-use REST API that
returns JSON search results for current and historic news articles published by over 80,000 worldwide sources.
